summary: Add shared durable journal, Raft-host replication, snapshots, and backup/restore lifecycle to Sift.
capability_refs:
  - id: replica-sync-and-bootstrap
    role: primary
    gap: sift-raft-state-machine
    claim: sift-raft-state-machine
    coverage: partial
    rationale: Sift must use the shared state-machine host when replica topology is configured.
  - id: backup-and-restore
    role: primary
    gap: service-backup-policy-and-runner
    claim: service-backup-policy-and-runner
    coverage: partial
    rationale: Sift snapshots must be reusable by the shared backup and bootstrap contracts.
  - id: durability-and-acknowledgment
    role: contributes
    gap: fsync-before-success-response
    claim: fsync-before-success-response
    coverage: partial
    rationale: The raw journal needs shared CRC-framed append and atomic snapshot mechanics.
