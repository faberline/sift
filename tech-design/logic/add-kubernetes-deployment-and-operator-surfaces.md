summary: Add reproducible Docker image, layered Kubernetes, and operator artifact surfaces for Sift.
capability_refs:
  - id: kubernetes-native-deployment
    role: primary
    gap: crd-operator-instance-render
    claim: crd-operator-instance-render
    coverage: partial
    rationale: Sift needs independently rendered image, CRD, operator, and instance layers.
  - id: developer-and-agent-experience
    role: contributes
    gap: offline-contract
    claim: offline-contract
    coverage: partial
    rationale: Deployment artifacts must be inspectable offline with runnable continuations.
