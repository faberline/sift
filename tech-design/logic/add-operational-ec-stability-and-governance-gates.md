summary: Add service-level operational contracts, stability evidence, and governance validation for Sift.
capability_refs:
  - id: ec-gates-configured
    role: primary
    gap: behavior-and-claim-closure-manifest
    claim: behavior-and-claim-closure-manifest
    coverage: partial
    rationale: Sift needs executable security, CLI, and resilience contracts rather than source-only claims.
  - id: long-running-stability
    role: primary
    gap: ingest-query-replay-soak
    claim: ingest-query-replay-soak
    coverage: partial
    rationale: Readiness, drain, bounded ingestion, and process lifecycle need regression proof.
  - id: developer-and-agent-experience
    role: contributes
    gap: interactive-tooling
    claim: interactive-tooling
    coverage: partial
    rationale: Agents need a supported local-cluster connection lifecycle and clean producer configuration.
