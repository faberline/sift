Contract invariants:

- The decoder accepts only `axiom.service.log.v1`, RFC3339 timestamps, known uppercase severities, nonempty bounded service/event fields, at most 64 bounded primitive attributes, lowercase nonzero 32/16-character trace/span ids, optional valid parent/flags/request fields, and a line no larger than the configured cap.
- `OperationalEventV2.event_id` is `stdout-` plus SHA-256 over stable source id, starting byte offset, and exact line bytes. Resource includes `service.name`, `service.version`, and `collector.source_id`; payload preserves the complete decoded service event; signal is `log`.
- A checkpoint is scoped to one source id and stores next byte offset, next line number, and cumulative accepted/duplicate/rejected counters. File size below its offset is a terminal rotation/truncation error delegated to #1675.
- The client sends the canonical `EventWriteRequest` to the existing bounded ingest route. Only network errors, HTTP 429, and HTTP 5xx retry. Other 4xx responses and item-level rejections stop without checkpoint advancement.
- Rejections never contain more than 1024 bytes of original input or 512 bytes of error text. They are written before the window checkpoint; valid later lines remain processable.
- Follow mode is valid only for regular files. It waits at EOF and re-enters the same window loop; it introduces no alternate parser or delivery semantics.

  - path: projects/sift/tests/structured_stdout_collector_e2e.rs

    section: unit-test
    impl_mode: hand-written
    description: Start real Sift, collect a Lumen JSONL file containing an invalid line and valid correlated events, query logs, and prove checkpoint replay idempotency.
```

The existing standardized crate root exports `pub mod collector`. The manifest adds direct `reqwest.workspace = true` and `service-observability = { path = "../../libs/service-observability" }`; these declarative seams let the collector own HTTP delivery and consume the producer-neutral schema without importing Lumen.
