id: "1660"
summary: Add the one-process asynchronous projection runtime, atomically durable per-projection state/checkpoints, replay jobs through SiftStateMachine, min-cursor waits, and a rebuildable embedded Lumen event index.
capability_refs:
  - id: materialized-observability-stores
    role: primary
    gap: projection-runtime-and-checkpoints
    claim: projection-runtime-and-checkpoints
    coverage: full
    rationale: This slice establishes the independent durable projection lifecycle consumed by every later domain store.
  - id: raw-event-journal-and-archive
    role: primary
    gap: replayable-view-rebuild
    claim: replayable-view-rebuild
    coverage: full
    rationale: Rebuild jobs consume only ordered canonical raw events and prove fresh/live digest equality before atomic install.
  - id: shard-aware-hot-storage
    role: contributes
    gap: rebuildable-hot-index
    claim: rebuildable-hot-index
    coverage: full
    rationale: Lumen is linked as an in-process derived index with no service, network, WAL, or Raft ownership.
  - id: schema-governance
    role: contributes
    gap: projection-index-allowlist
    claim: projection-index-allowlist
    coverage: full
    rationale: The embedded event index declares a fixed field allowlist and never indexes arbitrary payload or attribute keys.
  - id: query-tail-and-replay
    role: contributes
    gap: replay-cursor-and-view-rebuild
    claim: replay-cursor-and-view-rebuild
    coverage: partial
    rationale: This slice owns durable replay start/status and projection-lag primitives; the typed query/tail CLI and API remain #1671.
