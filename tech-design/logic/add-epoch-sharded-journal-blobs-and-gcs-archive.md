summary: Make Sift raw durability bucket/epoch aware, externalize large binary content before acknowledgement, seal movable segment manifests, and provide real GCS backup/source support through service-backup.
capability_refs:
  - id: raw-event-journal-and-archive
    role: primary
    gap: append-only-operational-event-journal
    claim: append-only-operational-event-journal
    coverage: full
    rationale: Sharded raw segments and manifests become the rebuildable source of truth while the v1 journal remains a compatibility reader.
  - id: shard-aware-hot-storage
    role: primary
    gap: 4096-virtual-bucket-routing
    claim: 4096-virtual-bucket-routing
    coverage: full
    rationale: Versioned epoch maps route future writes and sealed manifests preserve historical ownership without rewrite.
  - id: backup-and-restore
    role: contributes
    gap: real-service-backup-gcs-sink
    claim: real-service-backup-gcs-sink
    coverage: full
    rationale: service-backup gains a workload-identity/emulator compatible GCS sink and exact-object source.
  - id: durability-and-acknowledgment
    role: contributes
    gap: fsync-before-success-response
    claim: fsync-before-success-response
    coverage: partial
    rationale: Blob and routed raw-segment durability complete before acknowledgement; three-node failure proof remains D17.

      - { name: segments, type: "Vec<SegmentManifest>", required: true }
      - { name: blobs, type: "Vec<BlobRef>", required: true }
ordering:
  append: "durable blob -> routed segment fsync -> compatibility journal fsync -> state visibility -> ack"
  archive: "segment/blob objects -> hash verification -> archive manifest last"
  restore: "manifest -> objects -> hashes -> local manifests -> replay"
compatibility:
  v1_raw_journal: imported into epoch 1 segments at open and kept readable
  epoch_change: only cursors at or after activated_at_cursor use the new map
  movement: sealed bytes are copied and manifest location changes; event bytes are never rewritten
```
