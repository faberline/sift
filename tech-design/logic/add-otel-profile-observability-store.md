summary: Store OTel profile payloads in durable content-addressed blobs before raw acknowledgement, materialize bounded profile metadata and stack samples, and expose deterministic flamegraph, top-function, diff, trace-correlation, retention, and rebuild views.
capability_refs:
  - id: profile-observability
    role: primary
    gap: otel-profile-ingest-and-blob-durability
    claim: otel-profile-ingest-and-blob-durability
    coverage: full
    rationale: This slice owns profile blob externalization, reference validation, bounded journal metadata, and blob-before-ack proof.
  - id: profile-observability
    role: primary
    gap: flamegraph-top-functions-and-diff
    claim: flamegraph-top-functions-and-diff
    coverage: full
    rationale: The dedicated profile projection provides deterministic stack aggregation, inclusive/self totals, and comparison deltas.
  - id: profile-observability
    role: primary
    gap: profile-trace-correlation-and-rebuild
    claim: profile-trace-correlation-and-rebuild
    coverage: full
    rationale: Profile records preserve trace/span/resource context, apply retention, checkpoint independently, and rebuild from raw plus durable blobs.
  - id: materialized-observability-stores
    role: contributes
    gap: profile-store-and-analysis
    claim: profile-store-and-analysis
    coverage: full
    rationale: Profiles become an independently rebuildable first-class store with typed analysis queries.

durability:
  order: blob fsync -> bounded metadata event validation -> Raft/raw commit -> acknowledgement
  raw_rule: profile payloads at or above the configured threshold are replaced by one hash/size/encoding reference before raw append
  rebuild_rule: every referenced blob must exist and pass SHA-256 verification before its record is projected
